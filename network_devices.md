## Introduction to Network Devices

Network devices operate at different layers of the OSI model:

- **Layer 1 Devices (Physical Layer)**  
  - Analog Modem  
  - Hub

- **Layer 2 Devices (Data Link Layer)**  
  - Switch  
  - Wireless Access Point (WAP)

- **Layer 3 Devices (Network Layer)**  
  - Router  
  - Multilayer Switch (MLS)
##Layer 1 Devices
-**Analog Modem**
●- Word **Modem** is derived from the contrection of **modulator/demodulator**.
●- Converts **digital signals to analog** (and back)
●- Used to connect networks over phone lines (POTS) via PSTN.
   -POTS: Plain Old Telephone Service
   -PSTN: Public Switched Telephone Network
