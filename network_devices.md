## Introduction to Network Devices

Network devices operate at different layers of the OSI model:

- **Layer 1 Devices (Physical Layer)**  
  - Analog Modem  
  - Hub

- **Layer 2 Devices (Data Link Layer)**  
  - Switch  
  - Wireless Access Point (WAP)

- **Layer 3 Devices (Network Layer)**  
  - Router  
  - Multilayer Switch (MLS)

## Layer 1 Devices

### Analog Modem

● The word **Modem** is derived from the contraction of **modulator/demodulator**  
● Converts **digital signals to analog** and vice versa  
● Used to connect networks over phone lines (**POTS**) via **PSTN**  
    **POTS**: Plain Old Telephone Service  
    **PSTN**: Public Switched Telephone Network  
● Allows only a **single network connection**
