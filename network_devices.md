## Introduction to Network Devices

Network devices operate at different layers of the OSI model:

- **Layer 1 Devices (Physical Layer)**  
  - Analog Modem  
  - Hub

- **Layer 2 Devices (Data Link Layer)**  
  - Switch  
  - Wireless Access Point (WAP)

- **Layer 3 Devices (Network Layer)**  
  - Router  
  - Multilayer Switch (MLS)

## Layer 1 Devices

### Analog Modem

-● The word **Modem** is derived from the contraction of **modulator/demodulator**  
-● Converts **digital signals to analog** and vice versa  
-● Used to connect networks over phone lines (**POTS**) via **PSTN**  
     ○**POTS**: Plain Old Telephone Service  
     ○**PSTN**: Public Switched Telephone Network  
-● Allows only a **single network connection**

### Hub

-● A basic network device that **copies signals to all ports**
-● Doesn't know where data is from or going.
-● Can have few or many ports

## Layer 2 Devices

### Switch

-● Uses **ASIC** (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) for switching
-● Learns devices via **MAC addresses**
-● Connects local network devices

### WAP

-● Acts as a **bridge between wired and wireless segments**
-● Connects wireless devices using **802.11 standards**
-● Communicates only with local devices


####  802.11 Standards (Wi-Fi Family)

- **802.11a** – 5 GHz, up to 54 Mbps  
- **802.11b** – 2.4 GHz, up to 11 Mbps  
- **802.11g** – 2.4 GHz, up to 54 Mbps  
- **802.11n** – Dual band, up to 600 Mbps  
- **802.11ac** – 5 GHz, supports gigabit speeds  
- **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)** – 2.4 & 5 GHz, improved efficiency and speed  
- **802.11be (Wi-Fi 7)** – Upcoming, faster and lower latency (draft stage)

## Layer 3 Devices

### Router

-● Connects different networks using IP
-● Uses **software** for **decision-making**
-●  Finds best route using **routing tables**
-●  Communicates with local and non-local devices

### MLS

-● Works like a **Layer 2 switch + Layer 3 routing**
-●  Uses **ASIC for both switching and routing**
-●  Communicates with non-local devices
