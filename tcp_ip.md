## TCP/IP Model

A **practical model** used in real-world networking.

1. **Network Interface Layer**  
   Handles physical transmission using technologies like **Ethernet**, **Wi-Fi**, etc.

2. **Internet Layer**  
   Responsible for **IP addressing**, **ICMP messaging**, and **routing** between networks.

3. **Transport Layer**  
   Manages **end-to-end communication** using **TCP** (reliable) or **UDP** (fast, connectionless).

4. **Application Layer**  
   Interfaces with user applications and uses protocols such as **HTTP**, **FTP**, **DNS**, and **SSH**.
