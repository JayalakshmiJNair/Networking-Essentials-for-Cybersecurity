## Network Topologies

### a. Bus Topology
- Uses a single central **cable (backbone)**
- Simple and **inexpensive**
- Difficult to **troubleshoot** and isolate faults

### b. Star Topology
- All devices are connected to a **central hub or switch**
- Easy to **manage** and **scale**
- Failure of the **central device** affects the entire network

### c. Ring Topology
- Devices are connected in a **circular loop**
- Data travels in **one direction** (or both, in dual ring)
- One device failure can **disrupt** the entire network

### d. Mesh Topology
- Every device is connected to **every other device**
- High **redundancy** and **reliability**
- **Complex** and **costly** to implement

### e. Hybrid Topology
- **Combination** of two or more topologies
- **Scalable** and **flexible**
- **Complexity** depends on design
