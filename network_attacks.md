## Network Attacks

Understanding common network attacks is essential for identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening cybersecurity.

### **Phishing**
- Tricks users into revealing **credentials**, **credit card info**, or **personal data**.
- Typically delivered through **emails**, **fake websites**, or **social engineering**.

### **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**
- **Overloads a server** with massive traffic from multiple sources.
- Causes **downtime**, slows services, or crashes websites.

### **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**
- An attacker **intercepts communication** between two parties.
- Can **eavesdrop**, **alter data**, or **steal login information**.

### **ARP Spoofing**
- Sends **fake ARP messages** to associate attacker’s MAC address with a legitimate IP.
- Redirects traffic through the attacker’s system.

### **DNS Poisoning (Cache Poisoning)**
- Alters DNS records to redirect users to **malicious websites**.
- Can be used to **harvest credentials** or distribute **malware**.
