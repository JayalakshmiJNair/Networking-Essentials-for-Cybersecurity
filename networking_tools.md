## Networking Tools

A list of essential tools used in **network diagnostics**, **traffic analysis**, and **cybersecurity auditing**:

### 1. Packet Analysis & Monitoring
- **Wireshark** – GUI-based **packet analyzer**; used to capture, inspect, and analyze real-time network traffic.
- **tcpdump** – Command-line tool for **packet capturing and analysis**.
- **TShark** – Terminal version of Wireshark for advanced script-based packet analysis.
- **NetFlow Analyzer** – Monitors **network bandwidth** and **traffic patterns** using flow data.

### 2. Scanning & Discovery
- **Nmap** – Powerful **port scanner** and network mapper for **host discovery**, **OS detection**, and **vulnerability scanning**.
- **Zenmap** – GUI frontend for Nmap; great for beginners.
- **Angry IP Scanner** – Lightweight **IP address and port scanner**; cross-platform.
- **Fping** – Fast ICMP echo request tool to **ping multiple hosts** at once.

### 3. Diagnostics & Configuration
- **netstat** – Shows **network connections**, **listening ports**, and **routing tables**.
- **traceroute / tracert** – Tracks the **route of packets** from your machine to a target.
- **ipconfig (Windows) / ifconfig (Linux)** – Displays and configures **IP addresses** and network interfaces.
- **ping** – Basic tool to **test connectivity** and measure latency between devices.
- **dig / nslookup** – Query DNS servers and troubleshoot **DNS issues**.

### 4. Wireless Security
- **Aircrack-ng** – Cracks **WEP/WPA/WPA2** passwords; used in wireless pentesting.
- **Kismet** – Wireless network **sniffer and intrusion detection** system.
- **Reaver** – Tool to exploit **WPS vulnerabilities** in wireless routers.

### 5. Exploitation & Attacks (Ethical Use Only)
- **Ettercap** – **Man-in-the-middle (MitM)** attack tool supporting sniffing and ARP spoofing.
- **Bettercap** – Modern, modular MitM framework; supports DNS spoofing, credential harvesting.
- **Responder** – Tool for **LAN-based attacks** targeting services like SMB, LLMNR, and NetBIOS.

### 6. Performance & Load Testing
- **iperf / iperf3** – Measure **network bandwidth** between two devices.
- **Netcat (nc)** – Swiss-army knife tool for reading/writing data over **TCP/UDP**; useful for **port scanning**, **file transfers**, and **debugging**.
