## Wireless Security

Best practices to **secure wireless networks** and prevent unauthorized access:

- **Use WPA3** or **WPA2** (Avoid using WEP, as it's outdated and easily cracked).
- **Disable WPS** (Wi-Fi Protected Setup), which is vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- Use **strong, complex Wi-Fi passwords** that include upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Enable **MAC address filtering** to allow only known devices to connect.
- **Hide SSID broadcast** if possible, to make the network less visible to casual attackers.
- Use **Enterprise Authentication (802.1X)** for businesses, which provides per-user credentials and centralized access control.
